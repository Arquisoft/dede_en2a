== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain model

object User{
    name : String
    webId : String
    email : String
    password: String
    role : String
    verified : boolean
}

object Product{
    code: String
    name: String
    description: String
    price: double
    stock: int
    image: String
}

object Order{
    orderCode: String
    totalPrice: double
    shippingPrice: double
    orderReceived: boolean
}

object Review{
    rating: int

User *--> Order
Order o--> Product
Product *--> Review
User *--> Review

=== Security

Security is a very important concept in the context of a system, because we are managing information from users. It is important to ensure that the information is secure and that the system is not compromised. So, we decided to store in our system the minimun information necessary and obtain the other from the PODs. Also we decided to encrypt the users' passwords.

Also we added security in the backend to prevent unauthorized requests to the RestAPI, as well as to prevent the insertion of malicious code.

=== Testability

In order to ensure the correct functioning of the system, we decided to implement unit tests for each component. Also we implement e2e tests to check that the full system is working properly and that the user experience is good.
