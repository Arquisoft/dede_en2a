== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

=== Table 1. Technical Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Constraint| Explanation
|React | The React Framework will be used to implement the application
|Typescript| The programming language to be used to implement the application 
|Solid| Solid Specifications are required to preserve customer's privacy 
|Github| The version control is managed through GitHub, Git Bash. It provides tools for organizing and sharing the work. 
|===

=== Table 2. Organizational Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,7"]
|===
|Constraint| Explanation
|App development| There is a due date to develop and finish the app
|Team | The team creating the project is built up by 6 members
|Testing| Different scenarios will be taken into account to test a correct behaviour of the app 
|Meetings | We will discuss the organization of the tasks to do in a meeting at each laboratory class
|Experience | Team members have different experience when working with the diverse technologies going to be used
|Team Work | It is the first time for every member of the group working together to develop an application
|Coordination | A good coordination must be carried out by each component of the group to accomplish all the objectives proposed
|===

=== Table 3. Conventions

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Constraint| Explanation
|Language | The application must be navigable by any person that knows English.
|Clean Code | The code conforming the application must be well done and clean, so it is easier to understand and work with.
|Documentation| The documentation must be created by following https://arc42.org/[Arc42] Structure, so it is clear, simple and effective.
|Accessibility| The application must be easy to navigate through so any user interested on using it can do it easily.
|Programming Language Conventions | We should follow the conventions of every programming language that we shall use. (Solid, Typescript, Java...)
