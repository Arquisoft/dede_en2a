== Architecture Constraints

=== Table 1. Technical Constraints

[options="header",cols="2,3"]
|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|*React* 
|The _React Framework_ will be used to implement the _frontend_ side of the application.

|*TypeScript*
|We are using _TypeScript_ as the programming language for the whole project: both _front_ and _backend_. For the _restAPI_ we will use a combination of _Express.js_ with _Mongoose_ and _Node.js_. While in the _webapp_ we will use _React_ and _MUI_ as our main tools.

|*SOLID and Inrupt*
|_SOLID_ specifications are required to preserve customer's _privacy_. _Inrupt_ are the creators of most of the implementations to work with the previously  described specifications.

|*Github*
|The version control is managed through _Git_ and the repository is hosted in _Github_. Not only that, but also _Github_ allows us communicating and organizing the project

|*Continuous Integration System*
|We will use _Docker_ for us to deploy the application. Also a _virtual machine_ allocated in _Azure_ will be handy. Further information can be found in the next sections.

=== Table 2. Organizational Constraints

[options="header",cols="2,7"]
|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|*Size of the team* 
|The team is made out of six people, in case someone leaves we will a bit compromised. Indeed, one of the members left the group.

|*Testing*
|Different scenarios will be taken into account to test a correct behavior of the app. Some different techniques will be used to test the application with the higher-the-better coverage.

|*Meetings*
|We will discuss the organization of the to-do tasks in a meeting at each laboratory class. In case we need to arrange an extraordinary meeting, we will have to fix our schedules as we do not have the same timetables. Few extraordinary meetings took place: information about the meetings can be found https://github.com/Arquisoft/dede_en2a/wiki[here].

|*Experience* 
|Team members have different experience when working with the diverse technologies we are using. However, it is the first time we are creating a _real life_ project.

|*Working as a team*
|It is the first time for every member of the group we work together. More in more, some of us did not even met before.

|*Coordination*
|A good coordination must be carried out by each component of the group to accomplish all the objectives proposed.

|*Due dates*
|For sure we have to stick to some deadlines for us to deliver our project. This depends on the evaluation of the subject:
First delivery due by _February 22, 2022_, while the second is by _March 14, 2022_. The third will be _April 04, 2022_ and lastly _May 04, 2022_.

=== Table 3. Conventions

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Constraint
|Explanation

|_Language_
|Any person speaking _English_ must be able to interact with the application and successfully complete any task in it: _i.e_ calculating the shipping costs of a certain product to be delivered to a destination.

|_Clean Code_
|The code conforming the application must be well written and clean, so it is easier to understand and work with (_maintainability_ in mind).

|_Documentation_
|The documentation must be created by following the https://arc42.org/[Arc42] method: so it is clear, simple and effective.

|_Accessibility_
|The application must be easy to navigate through so any user interested on using it can do it easily. Regardless any disability.

|_Programming Language conventions_
|We should follow the conventions of the programming languages we are using. Some of those are the https://jsdoc.app/[_JavaScript_] conventions.

|_SOLID_
|The application must follow the https://github.com/solid/solid-spec[_Solid_] specifications.
