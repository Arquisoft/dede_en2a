.Motivation
For developing and testing, the execution environment will be running on the maching of each student. But, at the production stage, it will be deployed in a _Dockerized_ environment hosted on _Azure_. Our goal is to have a correct understanding of _Docker_: the infrastructure over which our system will be deployed.

.Quality and/or performance features
The performance on the deployment build will depend on the user's internet connection as well as on the _Azure_ servers used for the deployment of the app. Since those factors are out of our hand, we can do nothing with that. But the performance of the application can be maxed out with some coding approaches - then - privacy and security will be our main concerns for achieving the best and securest user's experience. 

.Mapping of building blocks to infrastructure
