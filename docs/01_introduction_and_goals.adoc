=== Quality Goals

|===
|Quality goal
|Motivation
|Concrete scenarios
|Priority

|*Privacy*
|"Your data, your choice"
|The only way for us to ensure privacy is allowing users to know what we do with their data. This is only possible if the source code is available for anyone to read it. More in more, we will allow users to use their data as they please, not as we do.
|High

|*Performance*
|"80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes"
|We will aim for the application to load in less than 1.5 seconds; indeed, 47% of the internet users expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less, so we are focusing in doing it better than the average. 
|High

|*Usability*
|"If a user is having a problem, it's our problem."
|We aim for 90% of the users to be able to complete any -separate- task in less than 2 minutes, without any previous knowledge of the app.
|High

|*Security*
|We wont be able to develop a good product unless data is stored in a secure place.
|Data must not be accesible for any third parties. Data from users will be stored in a secure system.
|High

|*Maintanability*
|"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live."
|Software industry averages 1-25 errors per 1000 lines of code. We will aim for higher execellence-ratios: 0.5 defects per 1000 lines of code.
|Medium

|*Freedom*
|"Free, as in freedom"
|The whole project, including all the components: code, documentation... Must be uploaded to a public repository, for it to be accessible to anyone in any place.
