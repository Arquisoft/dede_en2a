== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. These include

* underlying business goals, essential features and functional requirements for the system
* quality goals for the architecture
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.
****

The functional requirements that the application will have:

* The users will be able to select products to buy. Also they will be able to search for a specific product or filter them.

* Once the user has selected the products:
**They will be able to see the shopping cart and modify the units of each product.
**The system will calculate the shipping costs using different carrier APIs depending on the user's address.
**The user will be able to see the final cost of the order and select the payment method complete the order.
**The system will simulate the order shipping and will notify the user the different states.

* The user will be able to see the orders done.
* The user will be able to see reviews of the products.


=== Quality Goals

[options="header",cols="1,3,3,1"]
|===
|Quality goal
|Motivation
|Concrete scenarios
|Priority

|*Privacy*
|"Your data, your choice"
|The only way for us to ensure privacy is allowing users to know what we do with their data. This is only possible if the source code is available for anyone to read it. More in more, we will allow users to use their data as they please, not as we do.
|High

|*Performance*
|"80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes"
|We will aim for the application to load in less than 1.5 seconds; indeed, 47% of the internet users expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less, so we are focusing in doing it better than the average. 
|High

|*Usability*
|"If a user is having a problem, it's our problem."
|We aim for 90% of the users to be able to complete any -separate- task in less than 2 minutes, without any previous knowledge of the app.
|High

|*Security*
|We wont be able to develop a good product unless data is stored in a secure place.
|Data must not be accesible for any third parties. Data from users will be stored in a secure system.
|High

|*Maintanability*
|"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live."
|Software industry averages 1-25 errors per 1000 lines of code. We will aim for higher execellence-ratios: 0.5 defects per 1000 lines of code.
|Medium

|*Freedom*
|"Free, as in freedom"
|The whole project, including all the components: code, documentation... Must be uploaded to a public repository, for it to be accessible to anyone in any place.
|Medium

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.

|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| Students | Lorenzo La Rocca, Álvaro Rodríguez González, Pablo Lopez Amado, Andrés Martínez Rodríguez, Ángel Iglesias Préstamo and Noelia Iglesias Cuesta | Main developers of the application. They will develop the whole application and hence they will improve their teamwork capacity and coding skills.
| Teachers | José Emilio Labra Gallo and Pablo González González | They will supervise students work, make sure they are going in the right direction and help them if necessary.
| Users | Anyone that uses the application | Users will be the ones using the application so they have to find it easy to use, intuitive and practical.
| Empathy | Empathy.co is the commerce Search & Discovery platform built for trust with over 150 Developers and Search Engineers | They are interested in the project, especially in the part that deals with SOLID Pods because they are used and are important in their working area. Also to offer students business practices
