== Solution Strategy

=== 4.1 Technology Decisions

==== 4.1.1 Technology Stack
In order to _develop_ the application and fullfil the constraints we decided to use the following _technologies_:

* *MongoDB*: we chose to use _MongoDB_ during our last meeting on the 14th of February. Also _Mongoose_ for simplifying everything up.
* *SOLID specification*: lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called _POD_.
* *React.js*: is a _JavaScript_ library for creating UIs for web applications that is easy to learn. 

=== 4.2 Top-level Decomposition

==== 4.2.1 IDE
Our choice is _Visual Studio Code_ mainly because is available for many platforms such as _Windows_, _MacOS_ or _Linux_ and via _plug-ins_ it supports many programming languages and can be easily enhanced. _Git_ is a built-in feature included for _version control_. 

==== Diagramming tools
We are using _PlantUML_ for creating the diagrams of the documentation.

=== Approaches to achieve top quality goals

[options="header",cols="1,3,3"]
|===
|Quality goal
|Scenario
|Solution approach

|*Privacy and Security*
|The user will feel safe while using our product as his data will be stored as he pleases.
|We will use SOLID pods in order to achieve this. As we only manage the information that the user wants to share in his POD. We will aim for solving problems that may compromise the robustness and security of the application.

|*Usability*
|The user will perform the task he wants to do without any trouble.
|The use of CSS and JS frameworks that are pre-configured with that in mind. More in more, we will take advantage from the knowledge we earned from other subjects like SEW (Software y Est√°ndares para la Web). Some techniques such as metaphors or conventions, will be used.

|*Maintanability*
|The code we write will be easy to read and modify. No spaghetti code or any kind of code smells.
|We will implement design patterns and follow code conventions in order to achieve a clean code. More in more, we will write code with tests in mind, covering more than the 50% of the project.

|*Freedom*
|The project will be accessible for everyone to read it. This will include future students.
|By means of a public repository anything from our project will be available for everybody.

=== Organizational decisions

We have taken the following organizational decisions:app-name:

* *Language*: the whole project, including: the code, documentation and conversations among the team members - that includes: issues and other chats - will be in our shared language: English.

* *Issues*: even if private chats are a good tool for solving quick doubts, anything apart from that will represent an issue in _Github_. This way, anyone can see what we discuss about.

* *Kanban*: by means of this tool we will be able to plan the development process of the application. More in more, _Github_ has a built-in option for that purpose.
