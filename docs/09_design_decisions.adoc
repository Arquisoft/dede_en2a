== Design Decisions

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision
* ADR (architecture decision record) for every important decision
****

Those are the different decisions we have taken for developing our project. They are ordered by importance:

|Link to the ADR

| Typescript
| Solves one of the hardes inconveniences of using JavaScript: dynamic binding. This project is increasing its popularity among developers: probably the future of the web.
| None of us has ever used this programming languange. Indeed, we are not experts in JavaScript neither.
| This decision was not taken by us, we were told to use it in the project's assignment.

| React
| Aimed for simplifying the Frontend development process. Well documented. Developed by one of the biggest tech-companies: Facebook.
| Not only we are not experts in TypeScript, but we aren't familiarized with this library neither.
| This decision was not taken by us, we were told to use it in the project's assignment.

| MongoDB
| NoSQL database that is easy to work-with and integrate using TypeScript. Plenty of resources online.
| Transactions are not supported. Stores data by using high memory resources.

| Visual Studio Code
| Extremely easy to use. Lightweight and highly customizable. Available for many operating systems. Another advantage is the fact that is widely used in real-world project.
| We need to install a bunch of plugins for us to be able to develop the project in a more comfortabe way. More in more, we have to agree which of them we are using, so that everyone has the same UE (user experience).
