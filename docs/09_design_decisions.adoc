| *Typescript*
| Solves one of the hardest inconveniences of using JavaScript: dynamic binding. This project is increasing its popularity among developers: probably the future of the web.
| None of us has ever used this programming languange. Indeed, we are not experts in JavaScript neither.
| This decision was not taken by us, we were told to use it in the project's assignment.

| *React*
| Aimed for simplifying the Frontend development process. Well documented. Developed by one of the biggest tech-companies: Facebook.
| Not only we are not experts in TypeScript, but we aren't familiarized with this library neither.
| This decision was not taken by us, we were told to use it in the project's assignment.

| *MongoDB*
| NoSQL database that is easy to work-with and integrate using TypeScript. Plenty of resources online.
| Transactions are not supported. Stores data by using high memory resources.

| *Node.js* 
| However, we will use it in other courses: SDI, so it will become easier with the time. More in more, we need a backend framework allowing us to code faster. Becoming a trend this days. Highly used in companies outside.
| We have to learn it from scratch: we have never worked with it. We are not as familiarized with JavaScript.
| https://github.com/Arquisoft/dede_en2a/wiki/ADR-%236%3A-Backend-framework[ADR #6]

| *Express*
| Express is easy to use, minimalistic and works well with the technology stack we have chosen: MERN.
| It's the first time we are working with Express.
| https://github.com/Arquisoft/dede_en2a/wiki/ADR-%235%3A-REST-API[ADR #5]

| *mongoose*
| Makes working with MongoDB and JS way easier.
| We have never used it.

| *Visual Studio Code*
| Extremely easy to use. Lightweight and highly customizable. Available for many operating systems. Another advantage is the fact that is widely used in real-world project.
| We need to install a bunch of plugins for us to be able to develop the project in a more comfortabe way. More in more, we have to agree which of them we are using, so that everyone has the same UE (user experience).

| *plantuml*
| Works just fine with _Asciidoc_. We can share diagrams in a minimalistic way: few lines of code; images are way heavier.
| Not as easy to use as a graphical application.

| *Prettier*
| We all write code in a different manner, having a tool that manages the formatting is way too handy
| Custom formattings are not allowed unless you tell the plug-in to do it

=== Deprecated decisions

Some decisions we made during the development of the project, but that were reconsidered:

| *Java*
| Using this Language that we all have been using for so long we can be assured that there will not be any of the mistakes that comes with learning a new language..
| Its popularity is decreasing with the time. Nowadays other stacks are more popular; such as those that are based on JavaScript.
| We believe using one and only language will be more handy than using several: one for the frontend and one for the backend.
